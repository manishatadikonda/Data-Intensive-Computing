The graph in the excel sheet Graph.xlsx shows how the spark works for different file sizes. We have used the files ranging from 5 to 40 on splits of 5. We have captured 8 different times for both wordpair and word triplet code. These times are the running times of the code for different file sizes. The excel sheet also contains the table with these details.

Analysis:

The wordpairs have shown consistent increase until 35 files and then the time taken for 40 files went a bit down. Wordtriplets, unlike wordpairs, kept on increasing with increasing file size. This could be due to various factors like the performance of the system in which this code is run, file size etc. But on the whole, triplets took more time to run when compared to pairs code.
